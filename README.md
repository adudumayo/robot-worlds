Robot World:
In this team project you will build a client/server Robot World.

//This will consist of two programs:the server and the client.

#Server:
The server program is responsible for managing a world with its obstacles, robots and anything else we program into
the world.

#Client:
The client program is responsible for launching a robot into the world and controlling the robot in the world by
sending messages to the server program and receiving messages back in response.
